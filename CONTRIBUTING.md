## Pull requests (PRs)

- If you found a bug create an issue for it first and reference it in your PR.
- To avoid duplicate work create a draft pull request.
- Avoid cosmetic changes to unrelated files in the same commit.
- Avoid adding new dependencies (or prepare to justify it).
- Use a [feature branch](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows) instead of the master branch.
- Use a **rebase workflow** for small PRs.
  - After addressing review comments, it's fine to rebase and force-push.

## Commit style

No strict rules here. Just make it meaningful (e.g. "Fix something", "Add some feature", "Refactor some unit of code").

## Code style

Use prettier. There is a config for it and CI step which checks compliance.
